## About the Project

This project uses Node.js and the inquirer package to dynamically build a HTML document displaying employee detail cards. The app provides users with a series of prompts in the terminal, asking for information about their team, and uses JavaScript classes to generate various instances of the employee types. The app was developed using TDD and includes a comprehensive test package.
